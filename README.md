PK2 remakes
==========
Here you have all previous attempts to create pk2 remake

Folders:
* PK2Source - original pk2 source code
* Pekka Kana 2 (dev test) - a test based on xna platformer sample
* Pekka Kana 2 Modern backup (update to xna4) - just backup after update to xna4
* Pekka Kana 2 Modern - Main XNA remake
* pekka kana 2 - A first attempt to update original source code (windows forms)

in Pekka Kana 2 Modern folder you can find level editor but it was early prototype and it's hard to use

If you want to compile use Visual Studio 2010. For xna remake you need XNA 4 framework.

Original source code need Visual C++ 6 and directX SDK.
